# Static node names
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# "The name must consist only of alfanumeric and underscore characters 
# (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _), and is case sensitive."
# 
# After the name write the last IP octet. This is optional but recommended.
# Numbering of static nodes starts at 1 and is incremented the next 
# node once set.
#
# After the last IP octet write the DNS name or IP adress. At least one
# node needs a adress defined.
#
# After the adress you can define a port. If no port is defined 655 is used.
#
# If you just want to use a different port than 655 you can define the
# adress as "-".
#
#
# The format is: name last_octet adress port
#
# This file needs to be saved with Unix line endings!
