# Dynamic node names
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# "The name must consist only of alfanumeric and underscore characters 
# (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _), and is case sensitive."
#
# After the name write the last IP octet. This is optional.
# Numbering of dynamic nodes starts at 100 and is incremented the next
# node once set.
#
# After the last IP octet you can write a dyndns adress or IP adress.
# This is also optional but only possible if last IP octet is defined.
#
# After the adress you can define a port. If no port is defined it
# is incremented for each dynamic node strating from DYN_TINC_PORT+1.
#
# The format is: name last_octet adress port
#
# This file needs to be saved with Unix line endings!
